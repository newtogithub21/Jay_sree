        <h2 style="color: dodgerblue">Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Engineers' Day is a day to celebrate the achievements of engineers and their contributions to society. It is celebrated on <b>September 15th</b> each year in India to commemorate the <B>Birth of Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya</B>, a renowned engineer and statesman considered the <b>"Father of Modern India"</b>.</p>
        <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">History of Engineer's Day:</h2>
        <p>Engineers' Day was first celebrated in India in 1960, on the <u><b>100th anniversary of Visvesvaraya's Birth.</b></u> The day was chosen to honor Visvesvaraya's contributions to the field of engineering, as well as his role in the development of modern India.</p>
        <h2 style="color: darkorchid;">Why We Celebrate Engineer's Day?</h2>
        <p>Engineers play a vital role in our society. They design and build the infrastructure we rely on, from roads and bridges to buildings and machines. They also develop new technologies that improve our lives, such as medical devices, energy-efficient appliances, and communication systems.</p>
        <p>Engineers' Day is a day to <b>Celebrate the Ingenuity and Innovation of Engineers.</b> It is a day to thank them for their contributions to society and to inspire the next generation of engineers.</p>
